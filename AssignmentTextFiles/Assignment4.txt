Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository, 

The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name. 

The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository (You will need authorisation to do this).

I do not need to see your keys (see lab2)

Handup: Push the program as assignment04-github.py to assignments repository.

Marks: Marks will be given for the functionality and layout of the code; I do expect minimal comments to indicate you know what the program is doing.
